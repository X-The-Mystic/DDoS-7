# DDoS-7

This is a continuation of my DDoS attack sequence. It improves upon the previous, DDoS-6, by utilizing a Ping of Death attack. At randomized _x_-second intervals, it sends a large UDP packet in addition to smaller packets. It also uses a larger size for the cerberus_ascii_art variable. In my next project, DDoS-8, I will use instead TCP or ICMP packets, and maybe mutiple attack options, such as PySlow and SynFlood.
